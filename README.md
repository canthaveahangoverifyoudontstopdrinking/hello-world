Organizing first project. Titled - Whatever?

Hello, cheers to github. This calls for a biggie smalls monday marathon. 

Biggie on my mind, though that's far from the bottom line. Shit done changed? What ever stays the same? 
Bottom line is she bitched her way into this. Look at her now and all you'll see is a watermelon flavored chapstick balm resting on some crossed wires. What the fuck she doing here? No one knows. What the fuck she want? Noseyness is the only thing known.
